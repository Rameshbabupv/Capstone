59,PoliticalDiscussion,Should tax rates in the US emulate those in Sweden?,"Some people particularly progressives believe that the United States should replicate the taxation in Scandinavian countries such as Sweden.

* Instead of the top combined federal and state income tax rate of 43%, the maximum combined effective income tax rate is **57%**.

*  Instead of the top income tax bracket of 9.3 times the average national income, the top tax threshold is capped at **1.5** times the average national income.

* Instead of sales tax, there will be a Value-Added Taxes (VAT) at **25%**.

* The federal corporate tax rate is capped at **21%**.

* Increase both dividend and capital gain taxes to **30%**.

* No wealth tax

* No inheritance tax or gift tax

* Property tax for residential property is capped at around **$900**. Property taxes for commercial offices and industrial offices are 1% and 0.5% respectively.

**Should the United States restructure its taxation system in Sweden's image? Would such an act be feasible?**

60,PoliticalDiscussion,Should the White House continue to support Neera Tanden for director of the OMB?,"Neera Tanden is a longtime Democratic Party insider and key player who is currently nominated by Biden to be the director of the Office of Management and Budget, a hugely important position that oversees the $13 trillion dollar federal budget. Tanden has a long administrative resume, including having worked on several Democratic presidential campaigns and administrations including Bill Clinton, Obama, and Hillary Clinton's campaigns.

The OMB position is Senate-confirmable, and unfortunately for Tanden, that means that critics have brought up many of her tweets and public statements eviscerating her political opponents over the years. Tanden was very well known for holding nothing back, and often seared her opponents with acidic and fiery remarks on Twitter. She has achieved the rare distinction of inflaming tensions on both the left and right. Some examples include:

- [implying that Trump won in Florida only because voting machines were hacked](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ea9bd3b-5b2b-4e7c-bd88-690505e22105_825x827.png)

- calling Mitch McConnell ""Moscow Mitch"" and ""Voldemort""

- saying that Ted Cruz is a vampire

- [criticizing Bernie Sanders for not making his medical records public](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uULTbHNldS4/XkDilQGaWKI/AAAAAAAAKVw/89JVfgJ1A1gt2PQLHLG_kpzH-aOCNZ3mgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/greenwald%2Btanden.PNG)

- [harshly criticizing Bernie Sanders' supporters and accusing them of derailing the Democratic Party](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EoB5sjmXMAEP2dK.jpg)

These tweets have recently been the focus of Senate hearings as she goes through the confirmation process. In a blow to her supporters, Joe Manchin as well as some moderate Republicans - Romney and Collins - have indicated they will vote against Tanden. Democrats have postponed several committee hearings on her nomination as a result of this. However the White House has stood firmly behind her from the start, and still has not indicated it will budge or withdraw her nomination.

Was Biden correct in choosing Neera Tanden for director of OMB? Given the recent controversy and question of whether she can pass a Senate vote (especially with Manchin's decision to vote no), should the White House withdraw her nomination or continue to press forward with the vote?",ltctco,1614388637,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/ltctco/should_the_white_house_continue_to_support_neera/

84,PoliticalDiscussion,Should the minimum wage be nationwide or decided state by state?,"In the title, I mean should min wage be increased nationwide or decided state by state

I’ve lived in Washington for about 6 years, and went back to Alabama 2 months ago to visit my family. One of the first things I noticed is how cheap everything was. Compared to AL, food, gas, auto services, rent, etc. is sky high in WA. For example, renting a 2 bedroom apt in my town is about $1300 at the cheapest. You can easily rent a 2 bed in Florence, AL for $350.

While places like WA state would greatly benefit from a $15 min wage, it’s because the cost of living to min wage ($12) ratio is extremely high. In AL, on the other hand, the cost of living is a much smaller fraction of the min wage ($7.25) despite it being much lower. Would it more reasonable to focus on increasing the minimum wage on a state-by-state basis instead of raising the whole country to the same amount?",lt5v6q,1614368235,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/lt5v6q/should_the_minimum_wage_be_nationwide_or_decided/

90,PoliticalDiscussion,Should the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands be admitted as a state alongside DC?,"The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands is a US territory south of Guam in the western Pacific Ocean with a population of about 51,700 people. It's population is rather conservative, and the territory has elected Republican governors since 1993 (technically 2 were affiliated with the local reformist Covenant Party when elected, but later switched affiliation to the Republican Party while in office). With the push by Democrats for DC statehood, Republican senators have balked at the idea of creating an extra two safe seats for Democrats and have threatened to filibuster. Historically, when such partisan concerns are raised the Congress admits states in pairs to keep an even balance in the Senate. Should Congress do the same with DC and the Northern Mariana Islands? 

Some problems that I see: there are likely better candidates for statehood than CNMI. They are relatively low in population (essentially the size of a medium sized town), and to my knowledge haven't really pushed for statehood. While they are US citizens, the territory is outside of the US Customs scheme, so integration may be politically unpopular in the territory. Also, under this idea, Guam, a better candidate for statehood and their northern neighbor, would be left in territorial status. Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands are ethnically and culturally similar, so a consolidation could be considered, but doing so would weaken the partisan motivations for the simultaneous admittance. Guam is pretty swingy, though, so adding the rest of the Northern Mariana Islands to it may tip the balance enough to satisfy senatorial partisans.

It also leaves untouched the problem of Puerto Rico, which is considered a bit swingy, but also likely Democratic-leaning. Having just had a clear plebiscite asking for statehood, they have the strongest argument for statehood among all US territories, yet Senate partisans may object due to the fact that it may weaken Republican prospects at a Senate majority. If the Puerto Rican effort fails, it's difficult to see *any* admittance as politically viable.

The US Virgin Islands would also remain a US territory, which may upset Democrats interested in decolonization, with the current effort around DC and Puerto Rico offering the clearest opportunity to decolonize the US territories in one fell swoop. The Virgin Islands are pretty Democratic-leaning, so it's hard to see how they would be bundled into a compromise. Along the same lines, American Samoa would be left alone, but as far as I can tell they have a special relationship with the US that they want left alone, and would actively lobby *against* statehood, despite the relative lack of voice and representation in Washington.",lt1y4f,1614358609,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/lt1y4f/should_the_commonwealth_of_the_northern_mariana/

94,PoliticalDiscussion,What if Operation Eagle claw had succeeded?,"Operation Eagle Claw was a operation in April of 1980 to end the Iran hostage situation that had been going on since November of 1979. The operation had failed miserably with 8 US servicemen killed while withdrawing after a failed/aborted mission. The political consequences were far reaching as 1980 was an election year, and it was a close contest between incumbent President Jimmy Carter and conservative Ronald Reagan. Carter blames the loss in November on his inability to secure the hostages, while Reagan went on to win the election in real life. What if this operation had succeeded, would Carter win a second term? What would Iran-US relations look like regardless?
