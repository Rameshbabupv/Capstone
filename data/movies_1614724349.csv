Snyder, on the other hand, is an artist.  And a fine one at that.  Michael Bay and Snyder went to directing school together, did you know that?  You can definitely see it with how the score matches the set pieces.  Bay is *explosive*, Snyder is *Super Style Anime*.

Should I do it by genre or just slap them in wherever? Should I just put the name or a brief description? Obviously it's for personal use and I don't imagine sharing it other than giving it to friends for suggestions so it is up to me but it would be nice to hear suggestions on organisation so I don't end up 3 years down the line with trash organisation.

And while it may be easy to wallow in the tragedies that shape our lives...while it’s natural to focus on those unspeakable moments that bring us to our knees...we must remind ourselves that if we get up, if we just take the story a little bit further...If we go far enough, there is love. 

Notice that Elena doesn't mention her *mother's father -* our first hero, Will. Why? Is it because he committed suicide and ""wallowed"" in the tragedies of life? This movie seems to labor under the impression that if you *try really hard* to be happy despite all of the debilitating obstacles life has to offer, then everything will magically be okay. Will doesn't a deserve a place in the final monologue, but Javier, who decided to nope the fuck out of his son's life because Saccione had a crush on is wife, is somehow worthy?

Whenever he pops up on this subreddit it is inevitably because is he is perceived to be on some other level, but according to the video above this can be broken down into a creative decision by Cage and therefore seems worthy to me that in fact Cage is far more intelligent and creative than he is given credit for.

I thought it was Cora Sue Collins, but I was wrong, that special title goes to:

Marilyn Knowlden:

crazy it came out in 2009 time flies man feel like this came out yesterday, 2009 even feels like a very different time than today. Idk the purpose of this post but I just love the realistic vibe this movie instills ya know. I believe it’s one of those films that’s great but you can’t pinpoint exactly why it’s great.

 It always felt like a book movie to me as in it make a great book if written story wise. I feel like the scenarios show both sides of the aliens and humans bad and good sides And really plunges the main character into a melting of sides from humanity to alien is compelling and done well. It shows there is always two sides to a story. It paints the characters very well in terms of it breaks that action Hollywood cliche of predictability as you don’t know wether the main character is gonna die or win or succeed  or what.

59,movies,The Shining was an utter disappointment,"So, I am sure this is a hot take but I wish to actually have some discussion on this and hopefully understand other peoples perspectives: The Shining felt completely devoid of character or plot.  


I managed to stay away from any spoilers for what happened in it, except that it was a classic and was a Kubrick movie that was scary. I watched it recently because I wanted to see Dr. Sleep and it felt like a lifeless movie. Nicholson was phenomenal as per usual (all the acting actually felt well done) but was dislikable from the start. It felt like the movie was supposed to be a character study of his devolution up to what he does at the end (which was so blatantly foreshadowed at the start), but it never felt like that occurred. He was just kinda a shitty dude, then he starts being an ax murderer... He never devolves, it just kinda flips like a switch.  
And all the zombies, and ghosts, and ""the Shining"" of the kid and other guy aren't expanded on in any way... It was beautiful to watch as is Kubrick's style, but the movie was utterly devoid of life or character, and didn't develop a plot of any substance, and at no point feels scary (either ambient or jump scares/shock).  
It definitely isn't a movie I would recommend to anyone, except maybe so you know what the hotel is so you can understand Dr. Sleep better, because holy sh\*t was THAT an amazing movie!",lwg4xu,1614729523,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/lwg4xu/the_shining_was_an_utter_disappointment/

62,movies,What are some sad but violent (preferably revenge) movies,"There is only one movie which I've seen that fits this bill and it's 'Ghajini':

Ghajini - A wealthy businessman loses his fiance brutally after a large gang kills her, this man is also brutally beaten but survives with retrograde amnesia. He attempts to kill the killers and after a very emotional/dramatic ending fight, he succeeds, but this is all done in a very serious and emotional fashion, ending with him imagining himself next to his fiance. The background score is also amazing in this movie as well.

In short, I want to watch a very sad/emotional/dramatic movie that is centered on revenge/violence (as if the main character lost a love one or something similar), also it would be highly appreciated if the movie also has a good/emotional background score.

(I have already seen John Wick and Death Wish, and I'd say besides the music part, John Wick decently fits the bill, but Death Wish seemed more upbeat and action-oriented rather than emotional.)",lwg1nl,1614729243,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/lwg1nl/what_are_some_sad_but_violent_preferably_revenge/

No longer to be poisoned by civilization, he flees, and walks alone upon the land to become lost in the wild"".

The intense fighting scenes were few and that is okay. 

Also, Hans Zimmer. I loved his music already but I thought the score for this movie was hauntingly beautiful, if that is a good way to explain it. I really wish I could put it into words better. Did anyone else enjoy it as well?",lwfkkb,1614727777,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/lwfkkb/i_just_recently_finally_watched_blade_runner_2049/
71,movies,"'Nomadland' was a gut punch, it's a film about grief more than it is about the nomadic lifestyle.","Saw 'nomadland' the other day and I can't shake it off. 

At first I thought it was a film about US poverty/nomadic lifestyle, but it so much more than that. It does have a poverty element to it, but the exploration of life and grief throughout the film is superb. 

The scene with Swanky really left me thinking about life and the little things. 

The final scene though. That was so depressing, going back to see the life you once had just wither in the dust.",lwfid1,1614727589,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/lwfid1/nomadland_was_a_gut_punch_its_a_film_about_grief/

76,movies,About Time one of the best films ever made,"Hello,

I never thought I would be saying this about any movie, especially one about time travel. About time is one of those movies that are a dime a dozen; the type of movie to make you rethink your life, your choices, and the way you live. 

The premise of the movie is very simple; Tim, the main protagonist, has the ability to travel back in time to any point in his life and change it. He can't change his life after he has a baby as it changes too much of what he thinks as his present. His family has been able to do this forever and he is just the latest link in the chain.

The message of the movie is eloquently and masterfully done. I am not going to spoil the movie as it's ending needs to be witnessed without spoilers but it made me change my view on life. Full stop.

I always thought I appreciated the moments of my life but after watching I realized I wasn't as well as I should have. We all can't travel back and change the past so live in the moment. Live for the dream each day and make it your dam best day. You have a lifetime to do it but once you get to the end you don't get any do-overs, so make your life filled with little moments that you can look back on and be proud of.

Wake up and start your day full of life and appreciate the world around you. You might missing something new each day so just find it in your life. Even if everyday is the same there is always something that you can look on and be happy about. Live each day as though it were your last.

About Time is a movie about appreciation of the world around you and how you don't get another shot at the day, so make it the most.

If you haven't watched it before I will recommend it beyond a doubt. It is a movie everyone can learn from. It has changed my view on life and it I hope it can in yours. 

About Time is on Netflix and if you don't have Netflix, well there are others to watch. But I highly recommend this movie if you feel lost or just need a minute to breathe. It moves at a solid pace and will leave you in tears. 

Have a beautiful day Reddit.",lwfdkk,1614727197,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/lwfdkk/about_time_one_of_the_best_films_ever_made/

78,movies,"I Know the Title, Year, and Director, Still Can't Find the Short Film","Does anyone know where I can stream or buy the full 7-minute short film, Le Reveil (1996) by Marc-Henri Wajnberg? The English title is ""The Alarm Clock"". I watched it back in the 90s on the Sundance Channel, but aside from a minute-long clip of the opening, I have never been able to find the full-length short anywhere. It's an amazing, one-take, rube goldberg-inspired masterpiece of timing and cinematography that demands wider acclaim.

Its the new great escape! And not 3 hours long lol. Its not particularly anything remarkable but not all movies have to be! It does its job really well and I struggle to find anything wrong with it. There are some REALLY tense scenes in this. I think anybody would enjoy! It is a prime original so I'm sure a lot of you have already seen it on the page.

90,movies,Jewel of the Nile is as bad as I remember,"I'm a huge fan of Romancing the Stone, and I've always remembered it's sequel Jewel of the Nile as somewhat of a disappointment.  Well I revisited the film for the first time in about 30 years and time has not made the film any better.  It's like the film makers wanted to do the exact opposite of Romancing the Stone.  Instead of jungle we get desert.  Instead of a jewel we get no treasure.  Instead of adventure we get political bickering.  Instead of humor and suspense we get.. sigh.   
The young writer of the original movie died shortly after the film was made, and that is indeed a tragedy.  They could have at least started with a script that honored her memory, but it looks like they rushed out a film as soon as possible to capitalize on the original's unexpected success rather than try to make a decent followup.  It's not all bad though, the F16 sequence was pretty cool.  But that's about it.",lwexlv,1614725924,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/lwexlv/jewel_of_the_nile_is_as_bad_as_i_remember/
