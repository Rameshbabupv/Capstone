3,books,How to read and Why by Harold Bloom,"Yeah, I didnt like it. It's a non fiction book by the late literary critic Harold Bloom who was a big fan of the classics of literature especially Shakespeare. That's fine and all but the book didn't do what it set out to do which was show how we (average people who don't get the hype about the classics) how read them and appreciate. We small snippets of analysis of why passages and makes references to other literature but first of all I haven't read that book he's referencing! And that's how it keeps going. 

Harold was very critical of popular books, and I agreed with him that aren't literature in the sense of style or aim at constructing a written story in a certain way, but damn it at least I can understand those stories and discuss the big ideas it may be asking!

Her writing style, her characters, her descriptions really hook you to the story and make you want to read more, so after reading TSOA, I decided to read Circe, the most recent of the two novels.
I was surprised; at first it was slightly depressing, seeing her past and relationships with her (toxic) family, but as you gradually continue to read, you really start relating to her (or at least I did): her feeling of loneliness, the anger, her will, ecc.
The characters were amazingly described and made me rethink of how I view different members of the mythology.
I really would give it a try, because it really is a story that mixes the mythology with the feelings of a very modern and feminist woman.

10,books,Elena Ferrante is brilliant. That is all.,"Wow, just wow. This epic domestic fiction series, the Neapolitan Novels by Elena Ferrante, has left me speechless. I finished this 4 book series nearly two weeks ago and my mind is still reeling from the almost life spanning saga of the main characters, Lenu, friendship to Lila.  

I cherished reading these books to the point I took time between periods of reading the books so I didn’t have to brace myself for the conclusion so quickly and I’m glad I did. 

Here are a few bite sized not so hot takes and thoughts:

\-Lenu and the enigmatic, Lila, are the best representations I’ve read (or seen) on the fluctuating of female friendships, possibly in any form of media. Not much have I encountered one that has spanned a large expanse of time. 

\-How Ferrante shows the changes to family and marriage in the mid-late 20th century, in the books it is shown in Italy, is not as clear cut as history depicts it - the older generation were hesitant to the then young boomer generation and it didn’t change immediately after the 60’s - it was a gradual change onwards and afterwards. 

\-I can strangely relate to the insular nature/mentality of Lenu’s Naples neighbourhood, or more so the city as a whole, to my upbringing in a rural area in a different country. 

Just my appreciation of the Neapolitan Novels and I can’t wait until I read this series again years down the track with a richer appreciation and more life experience.",lwgvc6,1614731778,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/lwgvc6/elena_ferrante_is_brilliant_that_is_all/

Don’t get me wrong I liked reading that story, I found the characters really good and I think it’s the main thing that stuck with me during the whole experience. 
But I feel like I’ve read two entirely different books in one, and I think that the first one was a lot better than the second. 
If you’ve read it you obviously know why I think I’ve read two separate books, the story completely change when most of the main characters settle down in Boulder and it becomes more of a reflexion about the idea power than the sci-fi post apocalyptic book that I was enjoying in the first part and that I was expecting to continue. 
I absolutely love the fact that in the first part we follow a couple of survivors that are thousands of kilometers away from each other and how they all deal with the epidemic (loosing a loved one, wandering through huge and empty cities...) and I feel left out by the second part where they all face the main antagonist, Randall Flagg and it become more of a mini war between the two groups.

I’ve read the LHOTP books many many many times in my childhood. Every single one I could get plus the Rocky Ridge books. So I gave up trying to find alternatives and went back to

An example of this would be The Book Thief by Markus Zusak. I know it was published in 2005, but I also have Never Let Me Go by Kazuo Ishiguro, published in 2005 as well.

52,books,"Books you read as a child/adolescent that, upon reflection, truly shaped your way of thinking?","This was inspired by recent posts on a few subs I’ve seen where people talk about not retaining anything from books once they finish them, be it weeks or months later. While I agree remembering specific plot details after a while is uncommon, I’ve retained plenty from every book/short story/etc. I’ve ever read, some more than others. 

For example, I was 13 on a road trip with my family and best friend when we stopped at a large roadside “everything” store, they had a big book section and I picked up Amanda Boyden’s *Pretty Little Dirty* since it was cheap and the plot sounded halfway decent. The book is definitely for an adult audience but begins with the story of two best friends, Lisa and Celeste, who meet at the age I was when I picked it up. 

Without spoiling too much, the story goes on to follow the girls through their high achieving adolescence into adulthood where they fall into bad habits and even worse crowds. 

I finished the book on the 10 or so hour ride home and then passed it onto my friend who passed it to another friend who never returned it. About 2 years ago I reread the book on a solo round trip cross country flight and the emotional experience of realizing just how often phrases or bits of situations from the book crossed my mind over the years and how many times I’d let its lessons shape me without even realizing it was near overwhelming to experience while hurtling through the sky. 

It was surreal to read the novel again, this time from the perspective of the age the author is at the end of the story. It was beautiful, the somber reflection of a woman, her adolescence and ugly mistakes through the relationship that became her life’s lens. Boyden weaves in very real experiences that could have only come from someone who’s truly felt like they had nothing to lose with reflections of a wiser woman who finally learned her own value. I think it was her ultimate tone of self forgiveness that stuck with me all those years and in that I was somehow better prepared for the trials and tribulations of womanhood. 

Despite only reading it once as a young teen, I let myself deeply learn from Lisa and Celeste and upon introspection I found a lot of my notions of friendship/growing up/intimacy come from Lisa’s reflections on their relationship. Like when I went to my first real high school party, or when I was alone away from everyone I’d known in my college dorm for the first time, or when I was realizing I was in an abusive relationship, when I was faced with choices that shaped me and my womanhood i realized my mind had wandered to lessons and abstract memories I’d kept of the book and in that this novel shaped *me.* 

It got me thinking how often this happens even as an adult and if the stories we read aren’t really meant to be remembered as a whole and instead they impart knowledge by subconsciously adding and taking away weight from pieces of our existing informational structures. 

This is also why fiction is so important to so many people, it isn’t just the act of getting “lost in a book” and then being able to tell someone about it later, it’s letting that author’s world wash over you so much that you’re pulled out of your own mindset and forced into the perspective of the protagonist. 

This got a little longer than I expected, but I really want to hear other’s views on this and if anyone has a book they read either in childhood or a long time ago that “shaped them” in ways beyond just the story!",lwbjk2,1614716513,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/lwbjk2/books_you_read_as_a_childadolescent_that_upon/

That’s why with books, I feel the need to take a break after a book that truly impacted me to the point where I don’t want to let go of the book just yet, and Book Thief is just one example of many that has done this to me.

83,books,The Unreal and The Real by Ursula K Le Guin left me very upset,"Hi folks,
I'm a long time lurker (many years!) but today I break my silence because I've been shook...


Initially did not intend to buy it but when I saw it at the bookstore, I was in the mood for short stories, still waiting for something to be as good as Ted Chiang, and the name of the author rang a bell. I knew she is a renowned author and I didn't have a chance to read anything by her before so I bought the book.


I embarked on this volume curious to experience her writing and universe.
The first story was unremarkable, the characters are flat and the plot is very disjointed and failed to grip me entirely. It feels a bit like a Terrence Malick movie where bits and pieces of dialogue just fade in the background and you're left to piece the story back together and build your own interpretation. The difference is I enjoy those movies whereas I can't say as much for those stories... I headed into the second one thinking that maybe the first wasn't for me but I found it to be quite similar and flat. Plus the layout is misleading and makes it complicated to follow.


I'm kinda bummed because I was super excited about LeGuin, however this experience was highly disappointing. Are there better stories later in this volume? Better books from her? Is this her style and maybe it just doesn't work with me?


I have never felt so distraught by a book before, to the point I was asking myself if I developped any mental issues lately because nothing in these two stories registered and that's an absolute first for me.


Looking forward to read your opinions!",lw7uvw,1614706887,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/lw7uvw/the_unreal_and_the_real_by_ursula_k_le_guin_left/

92,books,Alexithymia - Emotionally Distant Book Recommendations,"Hi all. Found out today the name for the condition I suffer from: Alexithymia. I will include a link below to the description. Basically, I have trouble expressing my emotions, trouble reading other's emotions and trouble understanding my own emotions. I am starting on the path to heal and understand this better.

Any suggestions on books to read? Any approaches or therapies that work for you? Please share.

I plan to seek a specialized therapist as well. Just hoping I can do some research and understand it better.

97,books,Discussion about Tom Sawyer in Huckleberry Finn,"I fucking hate that little shit. Every single thing he does when he comes back into the story is annoying and drawn out. While I totally understand that Twain is using Tom as an allegory, he still ruins the book for me. Seriously, the annoying pseudo-intellectual shit, the ""let's make a super long plan that goes on for 6 chapters and keeps Jim from seeing his family"", the fact that all of his plans make no fucking sense, and his general personality are all so annoying. Again, I get that Twain wants us to be frustrated, but rereading the book is such a pain in the ass when Tom comes back.",lw6r37,1614704241,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/lw6r37/discussion_about_tom_sawyer_in_huckleberry_finn/

99,books,Dark Matter is a masterpiece,"Dark Matter is one of the best books I have ever read. It might be an even better fictional book than 11/22/63. There is something so thrilling about how easy it was to get sinked into the story starting from page 1. Also how human the characters were along with the simplistic complexity of the story! The lessons from the book are great too such as gratitude and how the smallest of decisions can have such large impacts. If you are going to read this please go in blind. It will be well worth it trust me. Also one of my favorite quotes from the book:


""I can't help but think that we're more than the sum total of our choices, that all the paths we might have taken factor somehow into the math of our identity.""",lw6p0b,1614704119,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/lw6p0b/dark_matter_is_a_masterpiece/
