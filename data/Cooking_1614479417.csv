2,Cooking,Mexican dishes for birthday dinner,"I’m cooking a birthday dinner this weekend for my wife. I have dessert plans, but for the main meal, the only prompt I got was “Mexican.” Fine. But to be honest, I’m having trouble thinking of anything better than a big ol’ fajita plate- flank steak, shrimp, grilled veggies, guacamole, pico de gallo, beans, the works, all made fresh (except the tortillas). This is something *I* would be happy with, but I always like to think a little bigger.

I would love any suggestions you folks might have for a main dish and a side or appetizer. Budget is not terribly important, I can find most ingredients, and the only dietary restriction is that it has to be pregnant-friendly (no raw meat, fish, or queso fresco).

3,Cooking,Watery Butter Chicken,"Hello all!!

Long time lurker and just generally a gatherer of Info.

So I followed this Matty Matheson Butter chicken recipe

https://youtu.be/G6Qjf6IyclQ  


And it came out watery and bland tasting.

I blended the vegetable base smooth and then sauteed it in ghee for about 20 min, added my spices, a cup of water and tomato puree. This was a bit thick at this point but I simmered it on super low for a little over an hour. However I thought it was too thick and added about a half cup of water halfway through simmering. I'm thinking this was my mistake.

I added my chicken and cream and butter and the result is kind of lack luster.

Was the issue I did not simmer the sauce long enough?

I have a big dutch oven worth of this chicken dish. Do you think it's salvageabe by continuing to simmer it? Even with the cream?

Thanks in advance!",lwhl2y,1614734017,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/lwhl2y/watery_butter_chicken/
4,Cooking,State of my art of frying chicken and making a bit of broth too,"Just jotting notes of how I'm doing it right now, for people who might find this interesting.

OK, so I did thighs. In a big pot, covered with water, plus soy sauce, celery salt, poultry seasoning, salt maybe. So you poach it til it's done, as in 160 degrees in the center. 

While it's poaching, set up your dry dip and wet dip. I did this the easy way: just use some of the dry dip in the wet dip bowl, but for the wet add a couple of eggs and water. The dry dip includes a lot of garlic powder, onion powder, poultry seasoning, celery salt, ginger powder, paprika, seasoned salt. Whatever. Have to use a lot, generally, and salty. Plus just about a third of a teaspoon, not really a full half teaspoon, of baking powder in the dry dip before you set some off for the wet dip.

The wet dip is some of the dry dip flour, two eggs and some water til it's about the thickness of a thin milkshake. 

OK, chicken comes out of the poaching at at 160 degrees, and you put it right into the dry dip. Let it sit as the oil for the chicken is heatingor is maybe ready. I used a thick-walled saucepan, that is not very big. This is one thigh at a time. Bring oil up to 325-350 degrees. The sitting thighs in the dry dip then go into the wet dip, covering. Then take just one out, throw it back into the dry, and pack hard, squeezing the dry dip into the chicken. When ready, set into the hot oil. 

We're talking pieces of chicken that are already cooked and hot. Watch it, and flip it in about one minute, maybe less, or it will burn. Flip again, maybe again, to get a ""double fried"" effect, then lay out on a grill/pan. 

That's it. 

Cooking the chicken first means your spices won't be destroyed (as much) in the frying process. Plain and simple. 

The poaching water is now ready to be frozen for use in soups or whatever, but beware, it's likely to be salty. Adjust accordingly and taste.",lwhh2z,1614733673,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/lwhh2z/state_of_my_art_of_frying_chicken_and_making_a/

24,Cooking,[Family Recipe] Shami Kebab - as narrated by my Grandma over the phone,"**Shami Kebab**  is, arguably, the most delicious of all kebabs and has been my all-time favorite. It is made with mutton or lamb or beef. The meat is cut and boiled with chickpea lentils in a pressure cooker. The patties are flavored with ginger, garlic, green chilies, fresh mint, coconut, and homemade garam masala and is often shallow fried or pan-fried. We went with shallow frying.
   
      
So, for the recipe, you can check out my [video](https://youtu.be/pJaDJHnEfqQ) where you can learn how to make this along with some additional tips or follow the directions below! :) It's an elaborate recipe but I've managed to make it into a relatively shorter video. I am sure the video will definitely help some of you out.

[Pictures](https://imgur.com/a/QCJHMkQ) of how my attempt turned out. 

Now let's get to the recipe. Here is what you'll need:

##INGREDIENTS:   

These ingredients will make 10 -12 kebabs, each between 50-55 gm

1.	Boneless Mutton or Lamb, high muscle &amp; low fat content: 750 gm
2.	Split Chickpea lentils, soaked overnight in room temp water: 150 gm
3.	Onions, sliced: 125 gm
4.	Ginger, cleaned &amp; rough chopped: 50 gm (We used 35 gm of concentrated paste because we couldn't find fresh ginger)
5.	Garlic, peeled &amp; crushed: 30 gm
6.	Green chilies, stems removed: 20 - 25 gm depending on your heat tolerance
7.	Fresh mint leaves, chiffonade: 15 gm
8.	Coconut, sliced : 50 -55 gm
9.	Bay leaves: 3 large pieces
10.	Ghee: 1 Tbsp. or ~10 gm
11.	Garam Masala: 1 Tbsp. or ~10gm (We used homemade garam masala)
12.	Salt: 1.5 Tbsp or ~15 gm
13.	Egg, large: 1
14.	Water, room temp: ~260 ml
15.	Oil, to fry: about half cup to shallow fry &amp; less if you will pan fry.



##DIRECTIONS:   

1.	For authentic Shami Kebab, you need to start the night before and soak chickpea lentils in room temp water for around 8 hours or overnight. Chickpea lentils are NOT pigeon peas or even Yellow split lentils. 
2.	The next day, remove the lentils on a strainer and let stand for a few mins to allow the water to drip off. 
3.	Clean the meat and cut into chunks. You need to remove excess fat and silver skin.
4.	To your pressure cooker, add the meat, lentils, onions, bay leaves, salt, &amp; water. (Remember the number of bay leaves added.) Give it a mix and cook on low to medium flame. Cooking time will vary on your cut of meat and your altitude. For me, it took about 1 hour and 2 whistles of the cooker. Note: If you have a pressure cooker and you are confident about the cooking time, you should use the pressure cooker to cook the meat since the process is faster. BUT, if you are not sure, go for a heavy bottom pot with a lid so you can easily check the doneness of the meat. Alternatively, you can do this in an instant pot as well.
5.	While the meat is cooking, prep the other ingredients. For that you need to start by toasting the coconut on a dry &amp; hot skillet. When the coconut is lightly browned, remove on a plate to cool.
6.	In a grinder or a blender, add the cooled down coconut, ginger, garlic, green chilies, and no more than 2 tbsp. of water. Make a coarse paste. Set aside.
7.	If you haven't already, chiffonade the mint by placing the leaves in top of one another and rolling it into a pipe shape. Then, chop finely with a share knife to end up with thin strings.
8.	When the cooker has released pressure naturally &amp; you are easily able to open the cooker, you are ready to move to the next steps. If there is still some water in the pot/cooker, burn off on high flame.
9.	Remove the cooked meat in a big bowl so that you can fish out the bay leaves. Count and remove all the bay leaves you added - this will mess up the grinding process if they end up in the grinder with the meat.
10.	When you are ready, add the meat mixture to a grinder and make a coarse paste. DO NOT add excess water at all.
11.	Remove the paste back into your big bow and add in the other things we had prepped: coconut paste with ginger, garlic, chilies, garam masala, ghee, mint, and 1 whole egg.
12.	Go in with your hands and combine everything together.
13.	To shape the kebabs, grease your hands with a drop of oil. Take a dollop of the kebab mixture and make it into a round patty. If you make a shape similar to mine, you should get about 10-12 kebabs of ~55 gm each. Alternatively, you can weigh every single one.
14.	Shallow fry or pan fry on medium to high heat, using neutral cooking oil.
15.	Remove on kitchen towels to soak off excess oil. 


**Serving:**
Serve with your favorite green chutney (I'll post a proper recipe for the chutney soon, if you like that) or try this quick recipe:    
*1 bunch of cilantro with stems removed, 40 gm of ginger and garlic each, 30 gm of green chilies, salt to taste, cumin seeds, and 20 gm of fresh mint, blended together into a fine paste with no more that 50 ml of water.*  


**Some useful tips and cooking notes:**    

1.	Chick pea lentils is NOT the same as pigeon peas or yellow split peas (in case you weren't aware of that). Garbanzo beans are also called chick peas, a.k.a *chana dal* in India. Yellow split pea is called matar dal. Yellow split pea is just that, a pea, while chick pea is a bean (although both are legumes). Furthermore, pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan), a.k.a pigeonpea, or red gram or tur/toor dal is also a legume that looks similar to the first two but is different. It is what will be used in yellow lentil curries in most Indian recipes. A visual differentiation between these might help: https://www.honestcookskitchen.com/post/shamikebab#viewer-7e84g

2.	If you have a pressure cooker and you are confident about the cooking time, you should use the pressure cooker to cook the meat since the process is faster. BUT, if you are not sure, go for a heavy bottom pot with a lid so you can easily check the doneness of the meat.

The video will certainly help some of you as it shows how to tackle some of the seemingly complicated aspects of the recipe but trust me, the appetizer is well worth it.

26,Cooking,Some probably very stupid questions about feta pasta,"Okay so I’d like to preface this by saying that I’m incredibly embarrassed that I’ve fallen prey to the TikTok hype surrounding this dish but I came across someone mentioning it and, well, I’m a sucker for pasta and anything low-effort. 

The way people are raving about the feta pasta is honestly quite crazy to me and while I know that that’s not saying much because this is the internet and people would eat their own shit if someone so much as implied that they wouldn’t have the balls to do so, I must admit that I’ve found myself inclined to want to give the recipe a try. 

However, I can’t get over the chunks of tomatoes that everyone just seems okay with eating. Don’t get me wrong, I love tomatoes but I love them a hell of a lot less when they’re warm and I just don’t see the appeal of eating them like that in my pasta. I was wondering if anyone has tried blending the sauce so that there aren’t any tomato chunks and if it still tastes good/works well? 

I’m also wondering if there’s a reason everyone seems so determined to make it with macaroni? I like macaroni but my family prefers spaghetti so I guess I’m just asking if I’d be committing a mortal sin if I made it with spaghetti for them instead. And also if the spaghetti gets the go-ahead, any tips on what type would be the best? 

Any other tips regarding this recipe would be much appreciated. 

I realise I might be asking very stupid questions but my inability to do anything cooking related without making sure I know what I’m getting my dumbass into is a habit of mine that I think I should maintain for the well-being of everyone involved. I think I’m just hoping to the delay the inevitability of me accidentally giving someone food poisoning and I hear this dish is impossible to screw up but my brain is nothing if not determined to do just that sometimes.

41,Cooking,Venison or steak flight?,"I was gifted this super cool gift card that allows us to order from local restaurants as well as order in specialty ingredients from further away. Right now I’m inclined to use part of it for a to-go date night and the other part to order in some fancy meats. I’m stuck on which meat option to go with though and would love your insight.

Option 1: Steak Flight
-	2 grass fed tenderloins 6oz each
-	2 pasture raised angus bone-in Ribeyes 20-22oz
-	2 domestic wagyu tenderloin steaks 6oz

Option 2: Venison Flight
-	2 lbs ground venison
-	1 lb stew chuck
-	1-2lb premium cut of some kind
-	2.5oz original stick bag (whatever that is)
-	1 peppered bar (jerky)

Both sound really awesome to me but I’m a little apprehensive about the richness of the steak flight.

It is so good.The sweetness from the blueberries and the turkey compliments so well with the nuttiness of the swiss, and there is a tiny bit of umami from a little bit of garlic powder sprinkled on the eggs. Also having a scrambled egg that's a little on the dry side allows it to absorb the reduction very well and kept it from running off the dish. However I've gotten literally hate comments message to me privately for me people saying that the dish was disgusting looking and I sat and thought about it and I was like a lot of Americans don't use fruit in their cooking at all with the exception of lemon, lime, and orange.

73,Cooking,New restaurant format/ideas to be imported in Italy - Any suggestion?," Hi guys,

Looking for some suggestions and ideas here, and this looked like the best place where to ask.

I work for a small italian real estate firm and we're searching new restaurants/retail format and ideas to be implemented in a major city in Italy. I'll clarify what i'm looking for.

We operates in a neighbourhood which today I would define as shabby. Some industrial building, some residential building (3 to 6 floors) with retail spaces on the ground floor. Retails that are not closed or abandoned offers very low quality food.

We are performing some investments (office buildings) over there hoping to give to this district a new life, therefore we belive that the activation of the retail on the ground floor is crucial to have people coming there and enjoy the time they spend in the district.

It does not need to have the best economics - as our initial purpose is to provide a reason to people to come to our district, we are ready to give some incentives to the restaurant/shop managers who will bet with us on this area.

Therefore we are looking for ideas and innovative formats that do not exist in Italy but that you may have in your country!

**The ideal restaurant/shop would be something like:**

* A unique format (small chains are also ok but no mcdonalds or burger king)
* Makes you feel welcome, not too formal
* Cool for both lunch time and dinner time
* A place where you would go back more than once
* A place that you're ready to travel for more than 30mins to reach (e.g. so interesting that I have to try it no matter how long it takes to reach it)

I leave for references two examples of what i'm looking for:

[http://www.yankeelobstercompany.com/](http://www.yankeelobstercompany.com/)

They are technically Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip Cookies. They also contain peanut butter chips. They do have the traditional ""fork crosshatch"" on the top, and before they're baked, the dough balls are rolled in white sugar. 

Also, they aren't any sort of 'special' cookie... so no vegan, keto, gluten free, or anything like that. Just regular old cookies.

I know you can do many different herbs like rosemary and thyme but I have never seen a curry plant in real life and know nothing of how to keep it alive.  I live in the southern part of the USA were we get lots a sunny days and heat.    


Anyone tried this? I am better of just getting a bag of leaves from the local shop?

91,Cooking,Does nonstick just come off by itself?,"I bought an expensive baccarat non-stick pan barely 4 years ago. I'm student and I love to cook so it was a pricey luxury. Since then I've taken care of it like it was my child. And it really only gets used maybe once or twice a month when I am cooking bigger meals for friends visiting. It still looks new, mince two minimal scratches that don't appear to be all the way through. 

I recently pulled it out of the drying rack (i only do sink wash only with soft cloth and nonabrasive soap) and found a massive piece in the middle had come off. It was about 5 cm circle size, and another smaller 2.5cm size. 

I thought my room mate may have something to do with it as I had been away for a month and hadn't seen the pan till I was emptying out the dish rack. 
However they claim that they did know anything about it and it wants there when they cooked or washed it up. 

I didn't find the pieces under the dish rack. Is it possible they just fell off?

Edit: I appreciate all the comments. But whether a nonstick pan is worth it or not, and how long they last, while interesting is not so much my point in question here.

Basically I think my room mate broke my nonstick surface pan and lied about it. But I don't want to say anything further until I know if anyone else has just had chunks of nonstick just flak  off and disappear with no sign of left over pieces. 

Is it possible to come off with no human intervention when it had no previous damage.

Thank you for all your time and input.",lu42tk,1614482204,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/lu42tk/does_nonstick_just_come_off_by_itself/

94,Cooking,What do you do when you make something too spicy?,"I just made a huge pot of Pozole and put way too many peppers in it. 
I put pineapples and sour cream on top to cool it down but wow it’s still spicy. 
I’m very seriously considering making a second pot to mix in since I think that’s my only hope. 
I added the extra peppers because it wasn’t quite spicy enough last time. I am an idiot.",lu3spz,1614481266,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/lu3spz/what_do_you_do_when_you_make_something_too_spicy/

96,Cooking,What other sauces/condiments should I buy at Asian supermarkets?,"I'm trying to up my knowledge in Asian cuisines, so I've compiled a list of sauces/condiments I buy in Asian supermarkets. I'd love if you could recommend me any others, and give any specific uses if needed. I know it's really broad, but based off recipes I've used, this is what I have in my pantry:

Soy sauce, tamari, kecap manis, fish sauce, oyster sauce, black bean sauce, hoisin sauce, chilli-garlic sauce, siracha, chilli oil, toasted sesame oil, ponzu sauce, yuzu juice, mirin, chinese cooking wine, rice vinegar, black vinegar, &amp; tamarind paste.

97,Cooking,Cooking pho meat in broth?!,"Hey everyone. I’m pretty new to cooking pho, but the few times I have done it, the meat was always pretty underwhelming, no matter how high the quality was. I can’t help but think it has a lot to do with cooking it the “traditional” way, by pouring the hot broth over the raw slices. I’d really like to cook the meat as I would for ramen, which is to say seasoned and cooked to medium rare, and then sliced. I feel like I would get a much tastier product from this. I also don’t season the raw meat slices before add the broth... I just make sure the broth is salty. Is that my mistake? Would I be committing some cardinal sin by cooking the meat separately?

98,Cooking,I'm forgetful and Stick Blender,"You'll see how the title actually makes sense.

For months...probably a year...I've wanted to get a stick blender. Nothing super fancy, just something I can use to puree soups because soup is a beautiful food.

Well, my friends, today I was at Bed Bath and Beyond shopping for a friend when I spotted a cuisinart stick blender on sale for $40. And considering I don't plan on doing any hard work with this machine, I bought it.

Here's the part where the title makes sense: now that I have it, I cannot think of any recipes to use it for besides homemade applesauce.
